# EMDOSE_dosimetry
A GUI-based internal dose calculator using ICRP phantoms and S-value datasets. Supports adult male and female models for I-131, Lu-177, and Ra-223.
# EMDOSE - Internal Dose Calculator

**EMDOSE** is a standalone GUI application developed to calculate internal radiation dose based on radionuclide distribution in human organs. It uses standardized S-value datasets and ICRP reference phantoms (Adult Male / Adult Female) to estimate absorbed dose delivered to each organ due to alpha, beta, and gamma emissions.

The application supports the following radionuclides:
- Iodine-131 (I-131)
- Lutetium-177 (Lu-177)
- Radium-223 (Ra-223)

### ‚ú® Key Features
- Graphical user interface (Tkinter-based)
- Choose between Adult Male (`am_`) and Adult Female (`af_`) phantoms
- Organ-specific dose breakdown (alpha, beta, gamma)
- Data source compatibility with MIRDcalc and ICRP reference datasets
- Export results to `.txt` or `.pdf`
- Built-in support for clinical or research use

---

### üì¶ Technologies
- Python (Tkinter)
- PyInstaller (for EXE generation)
- JSON-based S-value & self-dose matrices
- Optional PDF export via FPDF

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice for Running the EXE

Make sure to place the executable file (`EMDOSE.exe`) **in the same folder** as all the required JSON data files (e.g., `am_i131svalue_alpha.json`, `af_i131svalue_alpha.json`, etc.).

If the JSON files are not in the same directory as the EXE, the application **will not be able to find the necessary data** and will fail to run properly.

**Always keep the EXE and JSON files together in one folder!**
